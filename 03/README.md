# Introducing WebPack and fetch

## Tasks:
- create components/Page.js with fetch locations service, and rendering locations list as <ul>
- create config for bundling the file

## Steps:

#### - install webpack package
```
cd nui-workshop-exercises
npm install --save webpack
```

#### - make sure build scripts are in package.json file
- Add build scripts to scripts section
- as this is an example workshop, for each exercise to share
- same node_modules, make sure scripts are executed from ../../node_modules/.bin

```json
scripts: {
    "build": "../../node_modules/.bin/babel src --out-dir=lib",
    "prepack": "npm run build",
    "pack": "../../node_modules/.bin/webpack --config=webpack.config.babel.js",
    "prestart": "npm run pack",
    "start": "node lib/server.js",
}
```


#### - create webpack.config.babel.js file
- create and export object with property entry  for ./lib/app.js second property should be output that should be an object wjth path, filename andm publicPath  /dist/bundle.js




#### Create file components/LocationsPage.js
 - implement fetch of locations from http://localhost:3000/locations
 - render list of locations as UL list (no react, use innetHTML)

#### import components/LocationsPage.js into app.js
- call imported function

#### change static/index.html
 - serve bundle.js file from dist/ folder

#### run pack command
```
npm run pack
```
- make sure bundle.js is created in your dist/ folder


#### fix server.js
 - in add static replace static from /lib to /dist

#### kickoff the server
```
npm run start
```
and see that http://localhost:3000/static, http://localhost:3000/locations?num=2 still work
